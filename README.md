> yet another Discord bot.

The Bot is written in `typescript` on `nodejs` using the `detritus-client` library.

## installation

[[this has been tested on WSL2-Ubuntu and may be different on your OS.]] <br/>
you may need to install the following: <br/>

1. node.js
1. typescript
1. mongodb (database)
1. pre-commit

once you cloned the repository you may use your preferred package manager to install the packages.<br/>
to start the bot run:

```console
# only on the first building.
npm run build
npm start
```

if you want to develop the bot you can use the `npm run dev` command to automatically update the output code.
